you can create an index on any field on several fields to be used
together or on parts thereof that you want to use as a key the
keys in indexes allow you quick access to specific records and define
orders for sequential processing of a isam file after you no longer
need an index you can delete it addition and indexes have no effect
on the data records or on other indexes
you may want a field in field in each record to uniquely identify that
record from all other records in the file for example the employee
number field is unique if you do not assign the same number to two
different employees and you never reassign these numbers to other
